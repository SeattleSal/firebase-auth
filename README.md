# firebase-auth
using React and playing with firebase authentication

## Staring the project
intent is to play with firebase auth in a React project. I want to get the following in place:
* user sign up with email/pwd
* user login with email/pwd
* user sign out
* input checks for email/pwd
* error displays for user
